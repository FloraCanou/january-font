# January Font
January is my first font design work. 

## Design
January is a geometric-humanist sans-serif font. 

The design seeks to combine geometric and humanist features, inspired by [Cabin](https://github.com/impallari/Cabin) by Pablo Impallari and [Muli](https://github.com/vernnobile/MuliFont) by Adam Vernon. 

## Development
Version Beta 0 Alpha 6 (0.6.0)

The work is currently in alpha stage. The basic glyph set has not been completed yet.
